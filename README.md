# Capstone Day Log

#### Day 1

* Created init_notes.md
    * Chat structure from reading chat transcripts
    * Feature ideas
        * Parsed into externally and internally Interpretable
        * Also ideas for identifying things that may skew, session_category as a target Feature
    * Yup Questions
    * Misc Notes

* Created Variable description table (session_variables.csv) for session data
    * Included questions for Yup
    * Still needs formatting to make into real table.

* Created model_notes.md
    * purpose: to better define project scope and summarize research related to model selection.

Day 2 To-Dos
1. Read ~1500 lines of messages (Most recent) and record observations.
2.  Draft email to Yup on progress and asks for Wednesday no longer than 5 questions(incorporate session_variables.csv and init_notes.md questions)
3. Create basic survival curve using section_category == 'gap-bridged' as churn proxy. Plot it.
4. Complete Reading to-dos and write up Notes
5. Clean session_variables.csv
6. Look into academic research related to language in teacher student relationship

#### Day 2

* Read 1500 lines of messages and added more observations to init_notes.md.
* Drafted email to Yup
* Read all but one of research to-dos and recorded notes in model_notes.md
* Started creating the target variable (days to first gap-bridged)


Group questions
1. Concerned that my primary variable favors students that already know the material?
2. I'm interesting in measuring what determines a students transition to a growth mindset that is indicative of (gap-clarification or gap-explained) -> gap-bridged

Day 3 To-Dos
1. Finish first survival curve
2. Review survey and Write out questions for David
3. Refine target variable (take students that have more than 5 sessions and greater than 0.8 gap-bridged)
4. Look into academic research related to language in teacher student relationship
5. Clean session_variables.csv
6. Decide on a number of sessions for cut-off.
7. Find out how many people are dropping out of gap-bridged post bridging.
8. Average time to bridge


#### Day 3

* Added columns to student level data regarding variation of days to bridged
* Added first categorical variables platform and subject
* Started tuning target both min sessions subset and varying x-number of gap-bridged sessions needed to qualify as gap-bridged student.
* Completed KMF with categorical variables
* Completed Nelson Aalen estimator and plotted first hazard function
* Completed 1st Aalenâ€™s Additive model using subject as a categorical comparison.
* Met with David Lang and got the following takeaways: ADD AFTER MEETING
*

Blockers
* Concerned that subsetting is eliminating signal of some minority classes, bootstrapping from the donor lifetime study?
* Need help interpreting the cumulative hazard function to assist in the tuning process.
* Generally worried about high ratio of truncation and censorship and that I'm throwing away too much data.
* How soon should I start cross validation? ORder of events looking into bootstrapping

Day 4 To-dos:
1. Analyze
2. Add day of week and longer range seasonality/Acedemic year metrics to student data
3. Look into academic research on socratic learning (30 mins)
4.
