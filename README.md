# Capstone Day Log

#### Day 1

* Created init_notes.md
    * Chat structure from reading chat transcripts
    * Feature ideas
        * Parsed into externally and internally Interpretable
        * Also ideas for identifying things that may skew, session_category as a target Feature
    * Yup Questions
    * Misc Notes

* Created Variable description table (session_variables.csv) for session data
    * Included questions for Yup
    * Still needs formatting to make into real table.

* Created model_notes.md
    * purpose: to better define project scope and summarize research related to model selection.

Day 2 To-Dos
1. Read ~1500 lines of messages (Most recent) and record observations.
2.  Draft email to Yup on progress and asks for Wednesday no longer than 5 questions(incorporate session_variables.csv and init_notes.md questions)
3. Create basic survival curve using section_category == 'gap-bridged' as churn proxy. Plot it.
4. Complete Reading to-dos and write up Notes
5. Clean session_variables.csv
6. Look into academic research related to language in teacher student relationship

#### Day 2

* Read 1500 lines of messages and added more observations to init_notes.md.
* Drafted email to Yup
* Read all but one of research to-dos and recorded notes in model_notes.md
* Started creating the target variable (days to first gap-bridged)


Group questions
1. Concerned that my primary variable favors students that already know the material?
2. I'm interesting in measuring what determines a students transition to a growth mindset that is indicative of (gap-clarification or gap-explained) -> gap-bridged

Day 3 To-Dos
1. Finish first survival curve
2. Review survey and Write out questions for David
3. Refine target variable (take students that have more than 5 sessions and greater than 0.8 gap-bridged)
4. Look into academic research related to language in teacher student relationship
5. Clean session_variables.csv
6. Decide on a number of sessions for cut-off.
7. Find out how many people are dropping out of gap-bridged post bridging.
8. Average time to bridge


#### Day 3

* Added columns to student level data regarding variation of days to bridged
* Added first categorical variables platform and student_platform
* Started tuning target both min sessions subset and varying x-number of gap-bridged sessions needed to qualify as gap-bridged student.
* Completed KMF with categorical variables
* Completed Nelson Aalen estimator and plotted first hazard function
* Completed 1st Aalenâ€™s Additive model using student_platform as a categorical comparison.
* Met with David Lang and got the following takeaways: ADD AFTER MEETING

Blockers
* Concerned that subsetting is eliminating signal of some minority classes, bootstrapping from the donor lifetime study?
* Need help interpreting the cumulative hazard function to assist in the tuning process.
* Generally worried about high ratio of truncation and censorship and that I'm throwing away too much data.
* How soon should I start cross validation? Order of events looking into bootstrapping?

Day 4 To-dos:
1. Analyze the distributions
2. Add day of week and longer range seasonality/Acedemic year metrics to student data
3. Look into academic research on socratic learning (30 mins)
4. Basic NLP features (Why, What, Where, who, How), (# of '?')
5. In-depth EDA and summary to Darren


### Day 4 Summary

* Completed clear summary of EDA with markdown in an ipynb
    * Found interesting connection between gb rate and new students.
    * Also looked at different subset ranges and generally


Day 5 To-Dos
1. Narrow focus to a the areas I want to focus on for my MVP. I think its more likely to come from message data as we can make inference on how that effects learning outcomes in more understandable way.
2. Build out Language features and see if we can find linkages to gap-bridged.
3. Write up a short draft of what I've found so far for the company
4. MVP is a clean write up of my chosen narrative.
5. Make data_cleaning file that exports a csv in the data folder.
6.

### Day 5 Summary
* NLP feature engineering
    * word, char, question counts
    * Looked into the start of sentence structure
    * Also looked into a metrics capturing order of events.
        * positive correlation found between question count and session number/gb_rate!!!


Day 6/7 to-dos
* Email Michael and Swizec on status update.
    * Hold yourself to a deadline.
    * email about missing data.
    * thank and request meeting for next steps forward
* Work towards better visualization and a brief text description.
* Deep Dive into survey data

### Day 6

break

### Day 7 Summary

* Blog Post draft on student question rates.
    *
* Looked into survey data and I have a blocker based on not having a respondent id.
* Email out to Michael and Swizec requesting data and meeting for Tuesday


Day 8 To-dos
* Tweaks needed to visualization. tick formatting
* W-H word analysis
    * low : high level question ratios
    * low to high frequency
    *
* Talk more about possible survival analysis
    * Could we treat each non-gap bridged session as a learning curve, under the assumption that students are tackling a concept they don't understand yet.
        * Time = sessions til gap-bridged
        * Assumption we know yup handles just 3 subjects, so its likely students are focused on a narrow part of the curriculum.

Long term goals for week 2
1. Write-up and EDA on Survey Data (~400 words)
2. Try multiple models on the question of what determines gap-bridged
    * Hazard Curve
    * Decision tree
    * Simple logistic regression
3. Build out framwork,
    * Read Darren's slack pdf. Make a start on the r code.


### Day 8 Summary

* Read and implemented LME model in R
* Put together my MVP for Michael
    * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dlKYeW81oqKKNrlHRO4FlVZ8ZvlQ757EGtA3qmgnQGk/edit
* Cleaned Survey Data

Day 9 To-Do's
* Skim Chapter from Econometrics book.
* Knock out EDA on survey data and put together an MVP by EOD
* Set aside time for tomorrow to chat about LME.


### Day 9 Summary
* Survey analysis to no avail
    * Put findings into a notebook but I still need to put everything into a doc for Yup and send over for them. (2 hours work)
* Initial reading on LME

Day 10 To-Dos
* Implement LME and start tot refine model.
* Sort out data issues related to messages

### Day 10 summary
* We do have a working model that is (only when we scale and take away outliers and scale)
    * I think this is due to imbalanced classes
    * not converging
    * changed scale and some high outliers


### Day 11 To-Dos
* Testing assumptions
* Look up stuff on imbalanced classes
* Feature engineering based on Michael's requests. (gm words)
*

### Day 11 Summary
* iterated on and interpretted my logistic model
    * two branches of the model
        * student fixed, tutor random
        * tutor fixed and student random


### Day 12 To-dos
* More features
    * Canned Responses
    * name variations
* Balancing interaction with iterprability
    * How would I interpret a variable that interacts with another
* Which model is most viable or insightful

Interpretation Blockers
* Normality of random effects (http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~rlevy/lign251/fall2007/lecture_15.pdf) There is some evidence here that the intercepts are not normally distributed.
This is more alarming given that the model has assumed that the intercepts
are normally distributed, so that it is biased toward assigning BLUPs that
adhere to a normal distribution.

# Misc Notes
### Darren Notes
* Average time between sessions

### Michael Notes
* Canned Responses
    * Canned Response analysis
        * boolean of canned responses
        * canned vs. canned
        * canned effect on gap bridged
        * canned effect on session length
        * How long have you been using canned Responses
* Usage of "yet"
    * OR other growth mindset trems
    * "almost" and other growth mindset
    * tutor based





### Day 13 To-dos
* Survey analysis write-up

Phrases associated with growth mindset to check:
hard work
working hard
You're so close
You are so close
Nice effort
Good job
You've got this
You got this
Keep at it
Keep going
Keep trying
Almost there
Yet

* Survey Background
    * Michael to send guidence
    * Mindset shift
    * usage within Yup
    * dwech mindset
        * duckworth grit scale
            * Measure of percervience / growth mindset


* Random effects models
    * Allows a relaxtion of assuptions -> that all observations are independent
    * The error between each subject is incorporated into the error term.
    * Used when the subjects we have aren't neccesarily who we are interested in just a random sapling from a population.
    * Cross between bayesian and frequentist
    * Fixed effect is from the dependent variable of interest

    * Random effect is the effect that you're are uninterested in but want to account for.
