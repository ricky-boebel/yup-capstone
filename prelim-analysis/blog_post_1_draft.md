## Turn your child into Socrates with Yup

Yup's tutoring system is built towards encouraging the development of a growth mindset in their students. Tutors are focused on crafting a participative learning environment rather than giving out answers.

Using mobile chat as a platform gives students a familiar structure of communication that doesn't  exist in traditional education environments. Students know they are expected to respond leading to an interactive learning experience.

One year into to Yup's new socratic learning framework we've observed students seeing great results when they are participative.

Questions for Michael:

What can be added to the effect of:
Yup does BLANK to deepen the student tutor iteraction
I see students recognize tutors and vice versa, is the a result of a small user base or by design?
